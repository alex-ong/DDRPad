Main features: Fully wood, none of that metal stuff that costs $$$
Pretty reliable
Sensitivity tweakable, debounce tweakable.

I've personally only built v1, it seems fine.

Best accuracy was FEC on Mahou no Tobira / Love Shine, with around 20 Ex each.


You can also modify the sensitivity and debounce of the dancepad  with a gui, 
which communicates to the pad using serial. The settings are saved onto the pads
EEPROM so it remembers through power cycles.
